What's up, doc?
Dude
Teachers open the door. You enter by yourself.
Pay attention.
Come on, you're faster than this.
What am I?
What are you doing?
Who is asking?
Chop wood, carry water.
Try not to become a man of success but a man of value.
Out of clutter, find simplcity.
You must be the change you want to see in the world.
Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is important that you do it.
Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.
Whatever man thinks, he becomes.
