To create a Mac application from this code, follow these steps:

1) Compile the code from the root directory with SBT, using this command:

   $ sbt assembly

That command creates one JAR file from the code:

   target/BlueParrot-assembly-1.1.jar 

2) If a 'release' directory doesn't already exist in the root level of the
   project, create it.

3) Next, move into the 'build' directory, then run this Ant command:

   $ ant

That command creates this Mac application:

   release/BlueParrot.app

When working from a Mac Terminal window, you can run the application like this:

  open ../release/BlueParrot.app

Of course it's also a regular Mac application at this point, so you can just open
the 'release' folder like this: 

  open ../release

and then copy the application icon to your Dock.
